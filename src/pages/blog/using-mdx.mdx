This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import CounterReact from '../../components/react/Counter.tsx';
import CounterVue from '../../components/vue/Counter.vue';

<CounterReact client:load />

<CounterVue  client:load />


So the shiki theme on  `Vitepress` is a bug that overrides the background of the block? 
```typescript
import  { CSSProperties, useState } from 'react'

const style: CSSProperties = {
  border: '1px solid green',
  padding: '5px',
  margin: '5px'
}

export default function Counter({
  initialCount = 0, 
  step = 1
}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + step)
  return (
    <div style={style}>
      <button onClick={increment}>count:{count}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
